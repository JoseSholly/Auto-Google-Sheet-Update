## Google Spreadsheet Automation with Python
This Python project demonstrates how to automate updates to a Google Spreadsheet using the Google Sheets API. The project utilizes a virtual environment (venv) for managing dependencies and packages listed in requirements.txt.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-sheets-automation.git
cd google-sheets-automation
2. Set Up Virtual Environment (venv)
It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Here's how to set it up:

For macOS/Linux
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
For Windows
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages from requirements.txt:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This command will install the necessary packages including google-api-python-client for interacting with the Google Sheets API.

4. Set Up Google Sheets API
To use the Google Sheets API, follow these steps:

Go to the Google API Console.
Create a new project.
Enable the Google Sheets API for your project.
Create credentials (OAuth client ID) for a desktop application.
Download the credentials JSON file and save it in the project directory.
5. Configure Spreadsheet ID
Open update_sheet.py and replace 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID' with the ID of the Google Spreadsheet you want to update.

6. Run the Script
You're now ready to run the script to update your Google Spreadsheet. Ensure your virtual environment is activated, then execute:

bash
Copy code
python update_sheet.py
This will run the script, which will authenticate using the credentials file and update the specified Google Spreadsheet.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues with authentication or API access, double-check that the credentials file (credentials.json) is in the correct location and that the necessary APIs are enabled for your project.
Make sure your Google Spreadsheet ID is correctly set in update_sheet.py.
